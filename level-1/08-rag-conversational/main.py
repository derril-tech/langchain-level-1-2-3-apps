# --------------------- CODE NOTES ---------------------
# 1. Environment Variables:
#    We load the OpenAI API key from a .env file so it's not hardcoded in the script.

# 2. Language Model:
#    We use `ChatOpenAI` with the GPT-4o model for improved accuracy and reasoning.

# 3. Document Loading:
#    A `.txt` file is loaded and read into memory. LangChain supports various loaders for PDFs, web pages, etc.

# 4. Text Splitting:
#    We split large texts into smaller chunks to embed and retrieve more effectively. This helps with performance and relevance.

# 5. Embeddings & Vector Store:
#    Each chunk is embedded using OpenAI and stored in a Chroma vector database for fast similarity search.

# 6. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
#    Instead of asking the LLM to answer questions from scratch, we retrieve relevant context from our vector store and use that to answer.

# 7. Chat Prompts:
#    We create a structured prompt that guides the LLMâ€™s behavior when responding to questions.

# 8. RAG with Chat History:
#    We simulate conversations and keep track of chat history to handle follow-up questions more intelligently.

# 9. Session Management:
#    This allows each user or session to have its own separate memory using session IDs.

# 10. Final Output:
#    We print answers and show the chat history to see how the model tracks previous questions.
