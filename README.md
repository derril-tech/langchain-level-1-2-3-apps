# 🚀 LangChain Level 1 Applications

This repository showcases **Level 1 LangChain Projects** — standalone applications built purely with LangChain, without any frontend or backend integration.

Each project demonstrates how to use LangChain's core features to create powerful AI applications using Python. These foundational tools are ideal for anyone learning how to implement real-world use cases with LLMs.

## 🧠 What is LangChain?

[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is a powerful framework that simplifies the development of applications using large language models (LLMs). It enables chaining together components such as prompts, memory, retrieval, and agents to build context-aware and dynamic LLM-powered apps.

---

## 🔰 What Does "Level 1" Mean?

Level 1 refers to LangChain-only projects — no frontend (React, HTML, etc.) or backend (FastAPI, Flask, etc.) is involved.

At this level, we focus entirely on:
- LangChain’s **core components**
- Command-line-based usage
- Clear demonstrations of how LangChain handles memory, documents, tools, RAG, and agents

This lays the groundwork before moving into more advanced Level 2 (UI/API) and Level 3 (multi-agent, production-grade) apps.

## 🧪 How to Run Each App

1. Navigate to any project inside the `/level-1/` folder.
2. Follow the instructions in its own `README.md` to run it.
3. Run the Python file directly:

```bash
cd level-1/01-chatbot-memory
python main.py
```
