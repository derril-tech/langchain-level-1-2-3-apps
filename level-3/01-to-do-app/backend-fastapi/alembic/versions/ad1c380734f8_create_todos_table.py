# ALEMBIC MIGRATION EXPLAINED
# -----------------------------------------------

# üÜï What is this file?
# This is an Alembic "migration script" ‚Äî it defines what changes to make to the database schema.

# üß† What does upgrade() do?
# - It creates a new table called "todos" using raw SQL.
# - The table has 3 columns:
#     1. id (auto-incremented primary key)
#     2. name (text field for the todo item title)
#     3. completed (boolean, defaults to false)

# üîÑ What does downgrade() do?
# - It reverses the migration by dropping the "todos" table.

# üõ† Why use raw SQL here instead of SQLAlchemy?
# - You *can* use SQLAlchemy's table definition tools (like op.create_table), 
#   but raw SQL works just as well ‚Äî especially for simple tables.

# üîÅ When you run "alembic upgrade head", this script is executed.

# ‚úÖ When you run "alembic downgrade -1", the downgrade() part is executed to undo the change.

# üß± This is your starting point for building database schemas using version control!
